# Family-Tree Project

## Overview
The Family-Tree project aims to create an interactive 3D visualization of a family tree in honor of Taghiyev family. This application will allow users to view their family connections in a unique and engaging way, and to add new family members as the family grows.

## Features
- **3D Family Tree Visualization:** Utilizes Three.js to render a basic rotating cube, which will be the foundation for the more complex family tree visualization.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:**
  - **Framework:** React (TypeScript)
  - **UI Framework:** Material-UI
